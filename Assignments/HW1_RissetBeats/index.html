										<h2><a name = "overview">Overview / Logistics</a></h2>

										<p>
											The purpose of this assignment is to apply your knowledge of sinusoids in numpy to create a musical note sequence synthesizer with a very unique <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre">timbre</a> based on something called a <b>Risset beat</b>, as invented by the French composer <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Risset">Jean-Claude Risset</a>.  A Risset beat is a series of beat frequencies that all line up at the same time to make a pitch that stands out.  The background below describes the math in more detail.  By the end of this assignment, you will be able to write down a function that's just a sum of sines and cosines which plays an entire tune, which repeats itself infinitely! (Though we will only sample one repetition of it)

										<p>
											As we saw in our <a href = "../../ClassExercises/Week2/Week2_BeatPhase">class exercise</a>, it is possible to control where the peaks of beat frequencies occur by shifting their component cosines in time.  We can also make sure a beat occurs only once over an interval of time by choosing the right beat frequency.  For example, let's say that we have 5 seconds of audio (called <code>tune_length</code> in the code), and we want to make a beat with a 330hz frequency that occurs at halfway through at 2.5 seconds.  For it to occur only once, we'll want the period <code>T</code> of the beat to be 5 seconds, which means the beat frequency <code>f</code> should be <b>0.2hz</b> (recall that <code>f = 1/T</code>).  So choosing 329.8hz or 330.2 hz would be an appropriate choice.  A function that makes this happens is this
										</p>

										<h3>
											\[ y(t) = \cos(2 \pi * 330 (t - 2.5)) + \cos(2 \pi * 330.2 (t - 2.5)) \]
										</h3>

										<p>
											Below is the audio we get from this
										</p>

												<td><img src = "Examples/330beat1.png"></td>
											</tr>
										</table>
										<p>
											One thing that's a little unfortunate about this from a music making perspective is that the onset is very gradual.  It would be even worse if we were making a much longer tune.  To make the note stand out more over a shorter period of time, we can create more beats nearby.  For example, if we put together 329.6hz, 329.8hz, 330hz, 330.2hz, and 330.4 hz, we get the following:
										</p>

										<h3>
											\[ y(t) = \sum_{f = 329.6, 329.8, 330, 330.2, 330.4} \cos(2 \pi f (t - 2.5)) \] 
										</h3>

												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td><img src = "Examples/330beat2.png"></td>
											</tr>
										</table>
										

										<p>
											This definitely seems to stand out more against the background, but why does this happen?  To see this, we note that there are now beats all over the place!  In fact, we will have <b>N*(N-1)/2</b> beats for N frequencies.  In this example, we have 4 beats at 0.2hz, but also 3 beats at double that frequency, 2 beats at triple that frequency, and one beat at quadruple that frequency, for a total of 10 beats:
											
										<table>
											<tr><td>Beats at 0.2hz (Period 5)</td><td>329.6, 329.8</td><td>329.8, 340</td><td>340, 340.2</td><td>340.2, 340.4</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Beats at 0.4hz (Period 5/2)</td><td>329.6, 340</td><td>329.8, 340.2</td><td>340, 340.4</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Beats at 0.6hz (Period 5/3)</td><td>329.6, 340.2</td><td>329.8, 330.4</td></tr>
											<tr><td>Beats at 0.8hz (Period 5/4)</td><td>329.6, 340.4</td></tr>
										</table>
										</p>

										<p>
											These higher frequency "harmonic beats" will reach peaks in more places than the base beat, but they do all reach peaks at the chosen time offset, where they work constructively together to make a much stronger onsets.  In other places, they make these "side lobes."  But we can cut down on these if we use more frequencies.  For example, if we take 21 frequencies in intervals of 0.2 between 328hz and 332 hz, we get the following
										</p>

										<h3>
											\[ y(t) = \sum_{f = 328, 328.2, ..., 331.8, 332} \cos(2 \pi f (t - 2.5)) \] 
										</h3>

										</table>

										<p>
											Now we're getting somewhere!  This note is highly localized to 2.5 seconds in time now.  If we took this a step further, we could also put two notes together in this fashion.  Let's say, for example, that we wanted to put a note that's 287hz (a D) right before this note at t = 1.  We could then simply add these two together
										</p>

										<h3>
											\[ y(t) = \sum_{f = 328, 328.2, ..., 331.8, 332} \cos(2 \pi f (t - 2.5)) + \sum_{f = 285, 285.2, ..., 288.8, 289} \cos(2 \pi f (t - 1)) \]

										<p>
											As you can imagine, it's possible to make an entire composition this way, and the code to do so will be particularly short with the help of loops.  So that's what we'll be doing in this assignment!
										</p>

										<h2><a name = "programming">Programming Tasks</a></h2>
										<p>
											Your task in this assignment will be to create a program that takes a list of notes and their onset times, and to create a Risset beat for that note at each time.  The note should only occur once at its specified time, so you will have to carefully tune the beat frequency to ensure this based on the specified length of the tune.  You will also have to change its phase to control when its onset occurs.
										</p>

										<p>
											Some example tunes have been provided for you as .txt files.  Each line in the text file contains a note number, followed by a space, followed by the duration of the note in sixteenth note intervals (e.g. a quarter note concert A would be <b>0 4</b>).  For example, the file <code>Tunes/birthday.txt</code> contains the following
											<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: py"><![CDATA[
												-7 3
												-7 1
												-5 4
												-7 4
												-2 4
												-3 8
												-7 3
												-7 1
												-5 4
												-7 4
												-0 4
												-2 8
												-7 3
												-7 1
												5 4
												2 4
												-2 4
												-3 4
												-5 4
												3 3
												3 1
												2 4
												-2 4
												0 4
												-2 8</script>
											
											There is a helper method <code>load_tune</code> in <code>risset.py</code> to load these text files and convert the onset times into times in seconds.  <code>load_tune</code> takes two parameters: a path to the filename holding the tune, and the length of the tune in seconds.  The method returns two <i>parallel arrays</i>, <code>ps</code> and <code>times</code>, which contain the note numbers and onset times in seconds of each note, respectively.  To loop through each pair of note and onset time together, you can use <code>zip</code>

											<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: py"><![CDATA[
												for p, time in zip(ps, times):
											 		...</script>


										</p>
										<p>
											I have already setup calls to this method in <code>do_risset_slow</code> and <code>do_risset_fast</code>.  Here's an example of how you might call this code from a Jupyter notebook, assuming that the jupyter notebook is in the same directory as the starter code
										</p>

										<iframe src="ArpeggioExample.html" width="900" height="500"></iframe>

										<p>
											Thanks to the wonders of python and numpy, you will not have to write much code to accomplish these tasks, but you will have to think carefully about the code that you do write.  A good place to start would be to see if you can replicate the examples of single notes in the background, and then figure out how to extend that in a loop.  Use your ears to help you as you're debugging.  I have tried to provide as many examples as I can so you can check as you're incrementally developing.
										</p>

										<h4><a name = "rests">Rests</a></h4>
										<p>
											If the note number is a <code>nan</code> (not a number), then this means a "rest," or a silence (all 0s) for the requested duration.  The file <code><a href = "HW1_RissetBeats/Tunes/usher.txt">Tunes/usher.txt</a></code> has an example of rests, and the <a href = "../../webaudio-pianoroll/">piano roll editor</a> also supports them.
										</p>
										
										<h3>
											<a name = "naive">Part 1: A Naive Implementation (15 Points)</a>
										</h3>
										<p>
											Fill in the method <code>do_risset_slow</code> to implement Risset beats from the definition above.  You should use two nested loops: the outer loop should loop through the notes in a tune, and the inner loop should add an appropriate amount of frequencies spaced evenly around the corresponding note's frequency and at the right phase offset so that they occur at the right time.  
										</p>

										<p>
											Below is a video explaining the math below, for those who prefer that modality:
										</p>

										<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0hTsop3EM70" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

										<P>
											To make this concrete, let's recall the example from above
										</P>

										<h3>
											\[ y(t) = \sum_{f = 328, 328.2, ..., 331.8, 332} \cos(2 \pi f (t - 2.5)) + \sum_{f = 285, 285.2, ..., 288.8, 289} \cos(2 \pi f (t - 1)) \]
										</h3>

										<p>
											This can can be written as a two nested loops.  The loop on the outside goes through the center frequencies of <b>330</b> and <b>287</b>.  But for each of these, we also need to add a bunch of other frequencies together.  So the inner loop can do that for both <b>330</b> and <b>287</b>.
										</p>

										<img src = "LoopStructure.svg" width = 700 height = 150>

											Below are a few examples with more than two notes showing you what you should hear if this is working properly

										<h3><a name = "faster">Part 2: A Faster Implementation with Phase Aggregation Tricks (15 Points)</a></h3>

										<p>
											The above code certainly works, but it doesn't scale particularly well.  Let's say we stretched the audio out over 70 seconds and we used 500 frequencies per note to keep the onsets strong.  On my machine, this takes about 4 seconds per note.  But for any reasonable tune, this can be unbearably slow.   There's an example with an <a href = "Tunes/wanna.txt">excerpt</a> from Michael Jackson's <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XMvPTFzgVU">Wanna Be Startin Something</a> that has almost 200 notes in it, so it would take almost 15 minutes to generate a mere 70 second clip!  This would make it difficult to debug and tweak.  
										</p>

										<p>
											Luckily, there is a mathematical trick to play so that we only need a sine and a cosine for each unique note that's played, regardless of how many times it's played.  For this, we must turn to a trig identity:
										</p>

										<h3>
											\[ \cos(A+B) = \cos(A)\cos(B) - \sin(A)\sin(B) \]
										</h3>

										What this means is that if we have a sinusoid
										<h3>
											\[ y(t) = \cos(2 \pi f t - \phi) \]
										</h3>

										then, using the fact that cosine is an even function and sine is an odd function, we can write it equivalently as 

										<h3>
											\[ y(t) = \cos(\phi) \cos(2 \pi f t) + \sin(\phi) \sin(2 \pi f t) \]
										</h3>

										Let's now imagine that we had a bunch of the same sinusoid at different phases added together

										<h3>
											\[ y(t) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \cos(2 \pi f t + \phi_i) \]
										</h3>

										In the naive scheme, we would need to add together N cosines.  But with the above trick, we can reduce it to just a single sine and cosine as follows:

										<h3>
											\[ y(t) = \left( \sum_{i = 1}^N \cos(\phi_i) \right) \cos(2 \pi f t) + \left( \sum_{i = 1}^N \sin(\phi_i) \right) \sin(2 \pi f t)\]
										</h3>

										<p>
											In other words, sum up the cosine of all of the phases and use that as the amplitude of a pure cosine wave at the chosen frequency, and sum up the sines of all of the phases and use them as the amplitude of a pure sine wave.  <a href = "PhaseAggregation.html">Click here</a> for some notes of an example
										</p>


										<p>
											Implement the above ideas to speed things up in the method <code>do_risset_fast</code>.  Don't forget that you still need to add in all of the frequencies for each note to make a beat!  It's just that each one of these frequencies will be repeated each time you repeat the note, so you'll save by only having to have a sine and a cosine for each one.
										</p>

										<p>
											You should test this technique on happy birthday first to make sure you get the same sound (since this has repeated notes).  But this also unlocks the Michael Jackson example, where you'll hear something like this

										</p>
										<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: py"><![CDATA[
