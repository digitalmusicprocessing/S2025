										<h2><a name = "overview">Overview / Logistics</a></h2>

										<p>
											The purpose of this assignment is to apply your knowledge of sinusoids in numpy to create a musical note sequence synthesizer with a very unique <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre">timbre</a> based on something called a <b>Risset beat</b>, as invented by the French composer <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Risset">Jean-Claude Risset</a>.  A Risset beat is a series of beat frequencies that all line up at the same time to make a pitch that stands out.  The background below describes the math in more detail.  By the end of this assignment, you will be able to write down a mathematical function that's just a sum of sines and cosines which plays an entire tune, which repeats itself infinitely! (Though we will only sample one repetition of it)
										</p>

You will be editing the file <code>risset.py</code> and running methods from this file in jupyter so you can listen to audio.

										<h2><a name = "programming">Programming Tasks</a></h2>
										<p>
											Your task in this assignment will be to create a program that takes a list of notes and their onset times, and to create a Risset beat for that note at each time.  The note should only occur once at its specified time, so you will have to carefully tune the beat frequency to ensure this based on the specified length of the tune.  You will also have to change its phase to control when its onset occurs.
										</p>

										<p>
											Some example tunes have been provided for you as .txt files.  Each line in the text file contains a note number, followed by a space, followed by the duration of the note in sixteenth note intervals (e.g. a quarter note concert A would be <b>0 4</b>).  For example, the file <code>Tunes/birthday.txt</code> contains the following
											<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: py"><![CDATA[
												-7 3
												-7 1
												-5 4
												-7 4
												-2 4
												-3 8
												-7 3
												-7 1
												-5 4
												-7 4
												-0 4
												-2 8
												-7 3
												-7 1
												5 4
												2 4
												-2 4
												-3 4
												-5 4
												3 3
												3 1
												2 4
												-2 4
												0 4
												-2 8</script>
											
											<p>
												There is a helper method <code>load_tune</code> in <code>risset.py</code> to load these text files and convert the onset times into times in seconds.  <code>load_tune</code> takes two parameters: a path to the filename holding the tune, and the length of the tune in seconds.  The method returns two <i>parallel arrays</i>, <code>ps</code> and <code>times</code>, which contain the note numbers and onset times in seconds of each note, respectively.  To loop through each pair of note and onset time together, you can use an ordinary Java/C++ esque loop that indexes the arrays in parallel:
											</p>
											
											<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: py"><![CDATA[
												for i in range(len(ps)):
													p = ps[i]
													time = times[i]
											 		...</script>

											<p>
												Or, since you never need to use the index directly, you can use the more pythonic <code>zip</code>:
											</p>
											
											

											<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: py"><![CDATA[
												for p, time in zip(ps, times):
											 		...</script>


										</p>
										<p>
											I have already setup calls to this method in <code>do_risset_slow</code> and <code>do_risset_fast</code>.  Here's an example of how you might call this code from a Jupyter notebook, assuming that the jupyter notebook is in the same directory as the starter code
										</p>

										<iframe src="ArpeggioExample.html" width="900" height="500"></iframe>

										<p>
											Thanks to the wonders of python and numpy, you will not have to write much code to accomplish these tasks, but you will have to think carefully about the code that you do write.  A good place to start would be to see if you can replicate the examples of single notes in the background, and then figure out how to extend that in a loop.  Use your ears to help you as you're debugging.  I have tried to provide as many examples as I can so you can check as you're incrementally developing.
										</p>

										<h4><a name = "rests">Rests</a></h4>
										<p>
											If the note number is a <code>nan</code> (not a number), then this means a "rest," or a silence (all 0s) for the requested duration.  The file <code><a href = "HW1_RissetBeats/Tunes/usher.txt">Tunes/usher.txt</a></code> has an example of rests, and the <a href = "../../webaudio-pianoroll/">piano roll editor</a> also supports them.

You should use two nested loops: the outer loop should loop through the notes in a tune, and the inner loop should add an appropriate amount of frequencies spaced evenly around the corresponding note's frequency and at the right phase offset so that they occur at the right time.

										<h3><a name = "faster">Part 2: A Faster Implementation with Phase Aggregation Tricks</a></h3>

										<p>
											The above code certainly works, but it doesn't scale particularly well.  Let's say we stretched the audio out over 70 seconds and we used 500 frequencies per note to keep the onsets strong.  On my machine, this takes about 4 seconds per note.  But for any reasonable tune, this can be unbearably slow.   There's an example with an <a href = "Tunes/wanna.txt">excerpt</a> from Michael Jackson's <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XMvPTFzgVU">Wanna Be Startin Something</a> that has almost 200 notes in it, so it would take almost 15 minutes to generate a mere 70 second clip!  This would make it difficult to debug and tweak.  
										</p>

										<p>
											Luckily, there is a mathematical trick to play so that we only need a sine and a cosine for each unique note that's played, regardless of how many times it's played.  For this, we must turn to a trig identity:
										</p>

										<h3>
											\[ \cos(A+B) = \cos(A)\cos(B) - \sin(A)\sin(B) \]
										</h3>

										What this means is that if we have a sinusoid
										<h3>
											\[ y(t) = \cos(2 \pi f t - \phi) \]
										</h3>

										then, using the fact that cosine is an even function and sine is an odd function, we can write it equivalently as 

										<h3>
											\[ y(t) = \cos(\phi) \cos(2 \pi f t) + \sin(\phi) \sin(2 \pi f t) \]
										</h3>

										Let's now imagine that we had a bunch of the same sinusoid at different phases added together

										<h3>
											\[ y(t) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \cos(2 \pi f t + \phi_i) \]
										</h3>

										In the naive scheme, we would need to add together N cosines.  But with the above trick, we can reduce it to just a single sine and cosine as follows:

										<h3>
											\[ y(t) = \left( \sum_{i = 1}^N \cos(\phi_i) \right) \cos(2 \pi f t) + \left( \sum_{i = 1}^N \sin(\phi_i) \right) \sin(2 \pi f t)\]
										</h3>

										<p>
											In other words, sum up the cosine of all of the phases and use that as the amplitude of a pure cosine wave at the chosen frequency, and sum up the sines of all of the phases and use them as the amplitude of a pure sine wave.  <a href = "PhaseAggregation.html">Click here</a> for some notes of an example
										</p>


										<h4>Your Task</h4>
										<p>
											Fill in the method <code>do_risset_fast</code> to implement the above ideas.  Don't forget that you still need to add in all of the frequencies for each note to make a beat!  It's just that each one of these frequencies will be repeated each time you repeat the note, so you'll save by only having to have a sine and a cosine for each frequency.
										</p>

										<p>
											You should test this technique on happy birthday first to make sure you get the same sound (since this has repeated notes).  But this also unlocks the Michael Jackson example, where you'll hear something like this

										<h5><a name = "dictionary">Python Dictionaries</a></h5>
										<p>
											One way (not the only way) to tackle this in code is by using a <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp">dictionary</a> in python, which is like an array where the indices, or "keys," are arbitrary types, not numbers in a list index sequence.  For example, here's a map where the keys are frequencies and the values hold the amplitudes of the frequencies
										</p>
										<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: py"><![CDATA[
											sin_amps = {}
											# The first time we see a frequency, we need to add it to the dictionary
											# with an amplitude of 0
											if 330 not in sin_amps:
												sin_amps[330] = 0
											sin_amps[300] += blah # Whatever sin(phi) was for this note
										
											#... (Loop through and add more frequencies)


											for f in sin_amps: #Loop through all frequencies
												sinAmp = sin_amps[f] # Pull out amplitude of each frequency

										<h3><a name = "musical">Part 3: Musical Statement (5 Points)</a></h3>
										<p>
											You just made a basic digital synthesizer, now put it to use!  Make your own tune and synthesize it with one of your methods.  This can be whatever you want, but it should have at least 5 notes in it (and hopefully many more!).  If you're struggling with ideas, you can try some of the chords listed at <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chords">this link</a>.
											
										</p>
										
										<p>You are required to submit something as part of your assignment, but you may also optionally choose to submit your entry to a "music contest" that we'll hold as a class.  <b>The winner of the music contest will receive 2 points of extra credit on the assignment.</b>

										<h4>Even Faster Risset Beats!</h4>
										<p>
											If you have a <b>really</b> long tune for your art contest, you might want to use an even faster technique to implement Risset Beats using a tool we haven't learned yet called the Fast Fourier Transform.  <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF02GP3xYmg">Click here</a> to see a video I made about this, with code linked from a description
										</p>






										<h3><a name = "bored">For the bored...</a></h3>
										<p>
											Here are a few things you can try if you want to take this further, and which may enhance your musical statement (though you are certainly not limited to these!)
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												We've been using the same number of sinusoids for each note, but you can change the attack by using more or fewer sinusoids per note.  Add this feature and augment the text files with the tunes by specifying how many frequencies you want per note, in addition to the note number and its onset time.</li>
											<li>
												The notes occur in sequence right now, but you may also want to add chords where more than one note can play at once.
											</li>
											<li>
												What happens if you use some other periodic function, like a square or sawtooth wave, instead of a sinusoid?
											</li>
										</ul>
